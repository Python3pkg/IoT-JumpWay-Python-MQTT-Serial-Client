![TechBubble IoT JumpWay Docs](images/main/IoT-Jumpway.jpg)  

##Introduction

TechBubble Tecnologies Internet of Things (IoT) JumpWay is an IoT PaaS that allows anyone to connect IoT devices such as Raspberry Pi, Intel Galileo, Arduino, ESP8266 and even phones,PCs, Macs and laptops to the Internet of Things. The various IoT JumpWay libraries and samples allow you to connect devices and sensors to the IoT JumpWay and control/monitor sensors/actuators and data to and from the devices.

Python serial client library that allows devices that have no internet connectivity to communicate with the TechBubble IoT JumpWay MQTT Broker via serial.

### Library Installation
